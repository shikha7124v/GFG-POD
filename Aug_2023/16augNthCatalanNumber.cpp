// Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively defined objects.
// Their closed form is in terms of binomial coefficient - Cn = (1/(n+1))2nCn = âˆ‘Ci Cn-i, i=0 to n-1

// C0 = 1
// C1 = 1
// C2 = C0C1 + C1C0
// C3 = C0C2 + C1C1 + C2C0 = 2
// C4 = C0C3 + C1C2 + C2C1 + C3C0 = 14
// C5 = C0C4 + C1C3 + C2C2 + C3C1 + C4C0 = 42
